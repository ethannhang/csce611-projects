# CSCE 611 - Advanced Digital Design

## Lab 1
Write a RISCV assembly language program that reads an non-negative input value from the console, computes its square root, and prints the result to the console

## Lab 2
Develop a 7-segment decoder module to convert a 4-bit binary value into a 7-bit control code for the 7-segment display device on the DE2-115, and to use 8 instances of your decoder to display values on the 8 HEX displays on the DE2-115 board

## Lab 3
Develop a RISC-V processor implementing a 3-stage pipeline, along with a sub-set of the RV32I instruction set, along with a test suite validating that your design is implemented correctly
